This project utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and Panel to create an interactive interface for booking doctor appointments at Fortis Hospital. The system guides users through the appointment booking process, displaying doctor availability, and collecting user details. It includes features for handling weekdays-only bookings, generating unique token IDs, and sending email confirmations via SendGrid.
This solution leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, coupled with an interactive GUI powered by Panel for seamless user interaction.
